# New update
DevOps Tools:

1. Gradle :
Gradle showed up on the scene in 2009, and its popularity has 
steadily grown since then. Gradle is an incredibly versatile 
tool that allows you to write your code in Java, C++, Python, 
or other languages.
The best thing about Gradle is incremental builds, as they 
save a nice amount of compile time. 
Gradle allows faster shipping and comes with a lot of 
configuration possibilities.
2. Git
Git is one of the most popular DevOps tools, widely used 
across the software industry. It’s a distributed SCM (source 
code management) tool, loved by remote teams and open 
source contributors. Git allows you to track the progress of 
your development work.
3. Jenkins
Jenkins is the go-to DevOps automation tool for many 
software development teams. It’s an open-source CI/CD 
server that allows you to automate the different stages of your 
delivery pipeline. The main reason for Jenkins’ popularity is 
its huge plugin ecosystem.
4. Bamboo
Bamboo is Atlassian’s CI/CD server solution that has many 
similar features to Jenkins. Both are popular DevOps tools 
that allow you to automate your delivery pipeline, from builds 
to deployment. However, while Jenkins is open source, 
Bamboo comes with a price tag.
Bamboo has many pre-built functionalities that you have to 
set up manually in Jenkins. This is also the reason why 
Bamboo has fewer plugins (around 100 compared to Jenkins’ 
1000+).
5. Docker
Docker has been the number one container platform since its 
launch in 2013 and continues to improve. It’s also thought of 
as one of the most important DevOps tools out there. Docker 
has made containerization popular in the tech world, mainly 
because it makes distributed development possible and 
automates the deployment of your apps. It isolates 
applications into separate containers, so they become portable 
and more secure.
6. Kubernetes
A Kubernetes cluster consists of one master and several 
worker nodes. The master node implements your pre-defined 
rules and deploys the containers to the worker nodes. 
Kubernetes pays attention to everything. For instance, it 
notices when a worker node is down and redistributes the 
containers whenever it’s necessary.
7. Puppet Enterprise
Puppet Enterprise is a cross-platform configuration 
management platform. It allows you to manage your 
infrastructure as code. As it automates infrastructure 
management, you can deliver software faster and more 
securely. Puppet also provides developers with an opensource tool for smaller projects.
8. Ansible
You can use it to configure your infrastructure and automate 
deployment. Its main selling points compared to other similar 
DevOps tools are simplicity and ease of use. Ansible follows 
the same Infrastructure As Code (IAC) approach as Puppet. 
However, it uses the super simple YAML syntax. With 
Ansible, you can define tasks in YAML, while Puppet has its 
own declarative language.
9. Nagios
Nagios is one of the most popular free and open-source 
DevOps monitoring tools. It allows you to monitor your 
infrastructure so that you can find and fix problems. With 
Nagios, you can keep records of events, outages, and failures. 
You can also keep an eye on trends with the help of Nagios’ 
graphs and reports. This way, you can forecast outages and 
errors and detect security threats.
10. Raygun
Raygun is a world-class error monitoring and crashes 
reporting platform. Application performance monitoring 
(APM) is its most recent product. Raygun’s DevOps tool 
helps you diagnose performance issues and tracking them 
back to the exact line of code, function, or API call. The APM 
tool also fits well with Raygun’s error management 
workflow. For example, it automatically identifies your 
highest priority problems and creates issues for you


DataOps Tools :

1. Genie
Developed by Netflix, the DataOps tool is an open-source engine that offers distributed job orchestration services. This tool provides RESTful APIs for developers who wish to run a wide range of jobs with Big Data, such as Hive, Hadoop, Presto, and Spark. Genie also provides APIs for metadata management in distributed processing clusters.
2. Piper
Piper is a package of Machine Learning based DataOps tools that enable organizations to read data more smoothly and efficiently. This solution exposes data through a set of APIs which integrate easily with digital assets of the organization.
3. Airflow
Apache Airflow is an open-source DataOps platform that manages complex workflows in any organization by considering data processes as DAG (Directed Acyclic Graphs). This took was first designed by Airbnb to schedule and monitor their workflows. 
4. Automated Testing Tools
The second category of DataOps tools covers automated testing. Simply put, automated testing tools test and compare the actual outcomes of a software technique, versus the expected outcome. These tests are applied to repetitive tasks to identify the best methods.
5. Naveego
Naveego is a cloud data integration platform that allows businesses to reach accurate business decisions by integrating all company data in a regular business-centric format. This tool cleans stored data and makes it analytics-ready for data scientists.
6. FirstEigen
FirstEigen is a platform including Machine Learning tools that provide big data quality validation and data matching on the basis of self-learning. This platform learns about data quality behaviors and models using advanced ML techniques and then tests big data with just three clicks.
7. Right data
Right data is a self-service group of applications designed for achieving data quality assurance, integrity audit and continuous control along with automated validation. This suite is best suited for organizations seeking tools with automated testing and reconciliation capabilities. 
8. Badook
Badook is a popular tool among data scientists since it allows them to write automated tests for datasets used in training/testing data models. This tool not only allows them to validate data automatically but also reduces turnaround time for generating insights. 
9. Lentiq
This data model deployment tool works in a service environment for smaller teams. With Lentiq, you can run data science and data analysis at the scale of your choice in the clouds so your team can ingest real-time data, process it, and share useful insights.
